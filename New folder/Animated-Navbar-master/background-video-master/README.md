# Page With Video Background
In this tutorial ([Open in Youtube](https://youtu.be/XFmWyCX7LbQ)), I'm going to show you how to use modern HTML and CSS to create a completely responsive page with background playing video!
You can use this in your website design projects❗️

# Important
On Html file line 15 you need to add your video path :
```html
<video src="Your_Video_Path" autoplay loop playsinline muted></video>
```
